### The Amharic DBpedia Chapter
The Amharic DBpedia Chapter aims to integrate Amharic Wikipedia into DBpedia, making it the first sub-Saharan African language in the initiative. This project focuses on extracting, processing, and structuring information from Amharic Wikipedia to present it as Linked Open Data. By developing parsers, extractors, and mappings, the initiative enhances the representation of low-resource languages in DBpedia. This effort sets a foundation for other African languages to join the internationalization of DBpedia, contributing to a more diverse and inclusive semantic web.
